# Changelog

All notable changes to vallorcine are documented here.
Format: `## [version] — YYYY-MM-DD` with sections Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed.

---

## [0.1.5] — 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- `upgrade.sh`: when exec'd with `--apply` by the new script, pre-flight
  checks and the full fetch/download/extract block ran unnecessarily against
  the temp extract directory, causing an immediate exit before any files were
  applied; all args are now parsed upfront and both sections are gated behind
  `APPLY -eq 0`

---

## [0.1.4] — 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- `upgrade.sh`: `compare_versions` returns non-zero exit codes (1 and 2) which
  caused `set -e` to terminate the script before the return code could be
  captured — upgrade check always exited prematurely when a newer version was
  available
- `/release`: removed redundant `↵ confirm` step after version bump; all
  auto-proceed steps (push, GitHub release, CHANGELOG confirm) now proceed
  unless the user types `skip` or `edit`, eliminating Enter-to-confirm prompts
  that don't work in Claude Code's chat interface

---

## [0.1.3] — 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- `/feature-resume` now auto-invokes `/feature-plan` when that is the identified next step
- Autonomous mode opt-in moved to `/feature-plan` (before testing begins, not after)
- Crash recovery in autonomous mode auto-resumes without requiring a manual command
- "Hit enter to continue" prompts replaced with explicit "continue" keyword throughout
- `/feature-pr` now creates the PR via `gh pr create` directly, not just a draft file
- `/feature-init` prompts for a feature branch and applies project naming rules

### Added
- Handoff points offer to invoke the next command automatically as a sub-agent
- `DEFERRED.md` for vallorcine local development (pull-model, not loaded every session)
- `MANIFEST` file listing all kit-managed files
- `install.sh` and `upgrade.sh` remove stale files no longer in the kit MANIFEST
- Fail-forward upgrade policy documented in `upgrade.sh` summary output

---

## [0.1.2] — 2026-03-13

- Split CONTEXT.md into three bounded files with version sync
- Add tail-read rule for cycle-log.md to cap token cost
- Add escalation re-entry logic and WIP checkpoint system

---

## [0.1.1] — 2026-03-13

### Changed
- Split CONTEXT.md into three files: CONTEXT.md (active state, bounded),
  SETTLED.md (graduated design history), COMPETITIVE.md (market positioning)
- `/save-work` now graduates aged decisions to SETTLED.md and syncs DESIGN.md/README.md
- `/ideate` skips reference files unless the session goal requires them

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-13

Initial release. Two subsystems: TDD Pipeline and KB/Decisions.

### Added

**TDD Pipeline**
- `/vallorcine-help` — guided entry point, routes to /quick or /feature
- `/feature` — scoping agent with sequential one-question-at-a-time interview
- `/feature-init` — project profile setup with inference from existing project files
- `/feature-domains` — domain scout, commissions research and architect runs
- `/feature-plan` — work planner with token-based work unit split analysis
- `/feature-test` — test writer agent, TDD cycle management
- `/feature-implement` — code writer agent
- `/feature-refactor` — refactor agent with 6-category checklist
- `/feature-pr` — PR draft generator
- `/feature-complete` — archive and cleanup
- `/feature-resume` — crash recovery from status.md checkpoint
- `/feature-resume --status` — pipeline status display with --share mode
- `/quick` — lightweight single-construct path with complexity assessment
- Escalation chain: Code Writer → Test Writer → Work Planner with 3-strike limits and re-entry logic
- `cycle-log.md` tail-read rule — agents read last 30 lines by default, capping token cost

**KB/Decisions**
- `/research` — Research Agent, writes to `.kb/`
- `/kb topic` — creates new KB topics, maintains .kb/CLAUDE.md Topic Map
- `/kb lookup` — retrieves KB entries on demand
- `/setup-vallorcine` — initialises .kb/ and .decisions/ directories
- `/architect` — Architect Agent with 6-constraint deliberation loop
- `/decisions review` — revisits existing architecture decisions

**Infrastructure**
- Work unit splitting with token-based thresholds (15K crossover)
- `--unit WU-N` flag on inner-loop commands
- Enter-to-proceed prompts throughout (no yes/no required)
- `prompt-conventions.md` always-loaded rules file
- `DESIGN.md` — 9 design principles, structural patterns, token budget
- `CONTEXT.md` — active session context (bounded ~150-200 lines)
- `SETTLED.md` — graduated design history (pull-model reference)
- `COMPETITIVE.md` — market positioning and ecosystem gaps (pull-model reference)
- `RESUME.md` — session start/close instructions
- `install.sh` — idempotent installer, skip-existing, FORCE_UPDATE=1 to overwrite
- `VERSION` file with semver
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — plugin manifest for `/plugin install` native path
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — single-plugin marketplace for `/plugin marketplace add`
- `/upgrade-vallorcine` — checks source repository for new release tags, shows release notes, downloads and applies with confirmation. Never touches user-generated files.
- `upgrade.sh` — shell script installed into `.claude/upgrade.sh` in target projects. Downloads release zip via gh CLI or curl fallback, applies kit files only, preserves user content.
