# /architect "<problem statement>"

Runs a full architecture decision session for the given problem.
No file is written to .decisions/ until the user confirms in deliberation chat.

---

## Pre-flight guard

Before anything else, check that .decisions/CLAUDE.md exists.
If it does not exist, stop and say:
  "The decisions directory has not been initialised. Run /setup-vallorcine first, then retry."

## Step 0 — Parse intent and slug the problem

- Check whether the invocation includes a disposition flag:
  - `/decisions defer "<problem>" [--until <condition>]` → lightweight deferred write, skip to **Step 0D**
  - `/decisions close "<problem>" [--reason <text>]` → lightweight closed write, skip to **Step 0C**
  - No flag → full evaluation, continue to Step 1

- Extract the problem statement
- Generate `problem-slug` in kebab-case (e.g. "vector search service" → "vector-search-service")
- Check if `.decisions/<problem-slug>/` exists
  - If yes: read `adr.md` and `log.md`, ask whether this is a revision or a new problem
  - If no: proceed to Step 1

---

### Step 0D — Deferred write (lightweight)

Write `.decisions/<problem-slug>/adr.md` with status `deferred`:

```markdown
---
problem: "<problem-slug>"
date: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"
version: 1
status: "deferred"
---

# <Problem Slug> — Deferred

## Problem
<problem statement>

## Why Deferred
<reason given, or "not specified">

## Resume When
<--until condition, or "not specified — check back manually">

## What Is Known So Far
<any context or constraints already stated, or "none captured">

## Next Step
Run `/architect "<problem>"` when ready to evaluate.
```

Append to `log.md`:
```markdown
## <YYYY-MM-DD> — deferred

**Agent:** Architect Agent
**Event:** deferred
**Summary:** <problem> marked as deferred. Resume condition: <condition or "unspecified">.

---
```

Update `.decisions/CLAUDE.md` — add a row to the **Deferred** section.
Update `.decisions/<problem-slug>/CLAUDE.md` (Problem Index) with status `deferred`.

Display:
```
───────────────────────────────────────────────
🏛️  ARCHITECT AGENT — deferred
───────────────────────────────────────────────
Deferred: <problem-slug>
Reason:   <reason or "not specified">
Resume when: <condition or "not specified">

Recorded in .decisions/<problem-slug>/adr.md
Listed in .decisions/CLAUDE.md under Deferred.

To revisit: /architect "<problem>"
───────────────────────────────────────────────
```
Stop.

---

### Step 0C — Closed write (lightweight)

Write `.decisions/<problem-slug>/adr.md` with status `closed`:

```markdown
---
problem: "<problem-slug>"
date: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"
version: 1
status: "closed"
---

# <Problem Slug> — Closed (Won't Pursue)

## Problem
<problem statement>

## Decision
**Will not pursue.** This topic is explicitly ruled out and should not be raised again.

## Reason
<reason given, or "not specified">

## Context
<any relevant constraints or context that informed this closure, or "none captured">

## Conditions for Reopening
<if the user specified any, or "none — treat as permanently closed">
```

Append to `log.md`:
```markdown
## <YYYY-MM-DD> — closed

**Agent:** Architect Agent
**Event:** closed
**Summary:** <problem> closed — will not pursue. Reason: <reason or "not specified">.

---
```

Update `.decisions/CLAUDE.md` — add a row to the **Closed** section.
Update `.decisions/<problem-slug>/CLAUDE.md` with status `closed`.

Display:
```
───────────────────────────────────────────────
🏛️  ARCHITECT AGENT — closed
───────────────────────────────────────────────
Closed: <problem-slug>
Reason: <reason or "not specified">
This topic will not be raised again.

Recorded in .decisions/<problem-slug>/adr.md
Listed in .decisions/CLAUDE.md under Closed.

To reopen: /architect "<problem>" (will note prior closure)
───────────────────────────────────────────────
```
Stop.

---

## Step 1 — Constraint collection gate

Check whether the invocation includes a full constraint profile across all six dimensions.
If any dimension is missing or unclear, display the collection dialogue and wait.

### Six constraint dimensions

| Dimension | What to capture | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Scale | Data volume, request rate, growth | "10M vectors, 500 QPS, 2× growth/year" |
| Resources | Hardware, infrastructure limits | "CPU only, 16GB RAM, no GPU" |
| Complexity Budget | Team skill, operational capacity | "Small team, no ML expertise" |
| Accuracy / Correctness | Tolerance for error or approximation | "0.95 recall@10 acceptable" |
| Operational | Latency, uptime, rebuild cadence | "<50ms p99, index rebuilt nightly" |
| Fit | Language, stack, existing tooling | "Python stack, team knows NumPy" |

### Constraint collection dialogue

```
── Constraint collection ───────────────────────
To evaluate options I need your constraint profile. Please provide:

Scale              : <volume, throughput, growth — or "not specified">
Resources          : <hardware, infrastructure limits>
Complexity Budget  : <team skill level, ops capacity>
Accuracy           : <tolerance for approximation or error>
Operational        : <latency targets, uptime, rebuild frequency>
Fit                : <language, stack, existing tooling>

You can answer all at once or I will ask follow-ups.
Missing dimensions will be noted as unknowns and will reduce decision confidence.
```

### After collecting constraints

1. Create `.decisions/<problem-slug>/`
2. Write `constraints.md` using the **Constraints File Template**
3. Append the initial entry to `log.md` using the **Log Entry Template** with event `created`
4. State the top 2–3 constraints that most narrow the solution space
5. Proceed to Step 2

---

## Step 2 — KB survey

Display: `── Surveying KB ─────────────────────────────`

Read `.kb/CLAUDE.md` → relevant topic/category `CLAUDE.md` files.
Do NOT read individual subject files yet — use category indexes to identify candidates.

Produce a candidate list:
```
── Candidates ──────────────────────────────────
Candidates identified:
  ✓ .kb/algorithms/vector-indexing/hnsw.md
  ✓ .kb/algorithms/vector-indexing/ivf-flat.md
  ✗ DiskANN — not in KB (needs research)
```

---

## Step 3 — Commission missing research (if needed)

For any candidate not in `.kb/`, write `research-brief.md` using the **Research Brief Template**.
Then tell the user:

```
Subjects missing from KB:
  - DiskANN (algorithms/vector-indexing)

Research brief written to: .decisions/<slug>/research-brief.md

Run: /research algorithms vector-indexing "DiskANN"
Then re-run: /architect "<problem>"

To proceed without DiskANN, confirm and I will evaluate available candidates only.
```

Append a log entry: event `research-commissioned`, listing subjects requested.

---

## Step 4 — Deep evaluation

For each candidate:
1. Read the full subject file at `.kb/<topic>/<category>/<subject>.md`
2. Record the exact path — every score must reference it
3. Score against each constraint dimension (1–5, see scale below)
4. Identify any hard disqualifiers

### Scoring scale

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 5 | Excellent fit — purpose-built for this constraint |
| 4 | Good fit — meets constraint with minor caveats |
| 3 | Acceptable — meets constraint with notable tradeoffs |
| 2 | Poor fit — significant friction against this constraint |
| 1 | Disqualifying — cannot satisfy this constraint |

Weight scores by the user's stated priorities. Never override user priorities with generic defaults.

---

## Step 5 — Write evaluation.md

Write `.decisions/<problem-slug>/evaluation.md` using the **Evaluation File Template**.

Every score row must include:
- The KB file path it was drawn from
- A one-line note explaining the score
- The section anchor most relevant (e.g. `#complexity-analysis`, `#tradeoffs`)

---

## Step 6 — Deliberation loop (REQUIRED before writing adr.md)

**Do not write `adr.md` yet.** Present the recommendation in chat first.
The ADR is only written after the user explicitly confirms.

### 6a — Present the defence summary

Display this in chat (do NOT write it to a file):

```
───────────────────────────────────────────────
🏛️  RECOMMENDATION — <problem-slug>
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Recommended approach: <Subject Name>
Rejected: <Candidate 2> (<one-word reason>), <Candidate 3> (<one-word reason>)

WHY THIS APPROACH

<3–5 plain-language sentences connecting the recommendation to the binding
constraints. No jargon. State what tradeoffs are accepted and why they are
acceptable given the constraints.>

WHY NOT THE ALTERNATIVES

<Candidate 2>: <One sentence — which constraint it fails and how.>
<Candidate 3>: <One sentence — which constraint it fails and how.>

KEY ASSUMPTIONS
These are baked in. If any are wrong, the decision may need to change:
  1. <e.g. "Team will not gain GPU access within 12 months">
  2. <e.g. "Dataset will not exceed 20M vectors in year one">
  3. <e.g. "Python remains the primary implementation language">

WHAT THIS DOES NOT SOLVE
  - <Limitation 1>
  - <Limitation 2>

CONFIDENCE: <High | Medium | Low>
<One sentence reason — e.g. "All six constraints specified; all candidates in KB.">
───────────────────────────────────────────────
Do you agree with this recommendation?

  • Confirm — say "yes", "confirmed", "looks good", etc.
  • Challenge — raise any concern or disagreement
  • Provide new information — share a constraint or fact I didn't have
  • Request a reweight — ask me to prioritise constraints differently
  • Override — choose a different approach; I will document the reason

I will answer questions and iterate until we reach an agreed position.
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### 6b — Deliberation chat rules

**If the user asks a clarifying question:**
- Answer directly with a KB source reference if applicable
- Do not re-present the full summary — answer then return to waiting
- If the question reveals a constraint gap, note it and ask for the value

**If the user flags a topic as out-of-scope, deferred, or not worth pursuing now:**

Do not let it disappear. Immediately capture it:

1. Acknowledge briefly: "Got it — I'll log that and set it aside."
2. Append a `tangent-captured` entry to `log.md`:
```markdown
## <YYYY-MM-DD> — tangent-captured

**Agent:** Architect Agent
**Event:** tangent-captured
**During:** deliberation on <current problem-slug>
**Topic:** <the tangent topic, one line>
**Disposition:** <deferred | closed>
**User's words:** "<exact phrase the user used>"
**Resume condition:** <condition stated, or "not specified">

---
```
3. If disposition is **deferred**: also create a stub `.decisions/<tangent-slug>/adr.md`
   with status `deferred` (Step 0D template) and add it to the Deferred section of
   `.decisions/CLAUDE.md`. Tell the user: "Logged as deferred — it'll appear in
   /decisions when you're ready to pick it up."
4. If disposition is **closed**: create a stub `.decisions/<tangent-slug>/adr.md`
   with status `closed` (Step 0C template) and add it to the Closed section of
   `.decisions/CLAUDE.md`. Tell the user: "Logged as closed — won't surface it again."
5. Return to deliberation without re-presenting the full summary.

**If the user challenges the recommendation:**
- Acknowledge the challenge specifically — do not defend generically
- Re-evaluate the challenged constraint against the KB evidence
- If the challenge is valid: say "You're right — this changes the scoring"
  then re-present the defence summary with `[REVISED]` in the header
- If not supported by KB evidence: explain why, cite the KB section,
  then ask if the user wants to proceed with an override

**If the user provides new information:**
- Incorporate it, restate the affected constraint, update weight if needed
- Re-evaluate candidates against the updated profile
- If recommendation changes: re-present with `[REVISED]`
- If recommendation holds: explain why it still holds

**If the user requests a different constraint weight:**
- Accept without argument — weights are the user's prerogative
- Recalculate and re-present with `[REWEIGHTED]` in the header

**If the user wants to override:**
- Do not resist — acknowledge the override
- Ask one question only: "Can you tell me the reason? I'll record it in the log."
- Accept any reason given (or none)
- Proceed to confirmation with the override noted

**Clarifying questions the Architect may ask:**
One per turn maximum. Only ask when genuinely ambiguous:
- A missing constraint materially affects scoring between top candidates
- A user challenge implies a constraint not in the profile
- An assumption in the summary is directly contested

Never re-ask questions already answered in the constraint profile.
Never ask hypothetical or open-ended future questions.

### 6c — Confirmation and write

When the user confirms (any affirmative):

1. Say: "Decision confirmed. Writing the ADR now."

Display after writing:
```
───────────────────────────────────────────────
🏛️  ARCHITECT AGENT complete
⏱  Token estimate: ~<N>K
   Loaded: KB indexes ~3K, <n> subject files ~<N>K
   Wrote:  constraints ~1K, evaluation ~2K, adr ~3K, log entry ~1K
───────────────────────────────────────────────
Decision written: .decisions/<slug>/adr.md
```
2. If constraints were updated during deliberation:
   - Append `## Updates YYYY-MM-DD` to `constraints.md`
3. Write `.decisions/<problem-slug>/adr.md` using the **ADR Template**
   - If an override occurred, add this block after the Decision section:
     ```
     > **Override note:** The scored evaluation favoured <original candidate>.
     > This ADR reflects the user's choice of <overridden candidate>.
     > Override reason: <reason provided, or "not stated">
     > See [evaluation.md](evaluation.md) for the original scoring.
     ```
4. Write the deliberation log entry to `log.md` using the **Deliberation Log Entry Template**
5. Proceed to Step 7

---

## Step 7 — Update indexes and enforce context budget

1. The log entry was already written at Step 6c — do not write a second entry
2. Create or update `.decisions/<problem-slug>/CLAUDE.md` using the **Problem Index Template**
3. Update `.decisions/CLAUDE.md` master index:
   - Add the problem to the Active Decisions table
   - Check "Recently Accepted": if it exceeds 5 rows, move the oldest row to `history.md`
   - Check total line count: if over 80 lines, continue moving oldest accepted rows to `history.md`
   - If `history.md` does not exist, create it from the **History File Template** first
   - Ensure `Archived: [history.md](history.md)` pointer line is present

## Quality checklist (self-verify before ending session)

**Evaluation**
- [ ] Constraint profile complete — all six dimensions addressed or marked unknown
- [ ] Top 2–3 binding constraints named explicitly before evaluation began
- [ ] Every score in evaluation.md has a note and a KB path
- [ ] Every KB subject read is listed in evaluation.md frontmatter candidates:
- [ ] Hard disqualifiers called out explicitly, not just reflected in low scores

**Deliberation**
- [ ] Defence summary presented in chat before any ADR was written
- [ ] All user questions answered with KB references where applicable
